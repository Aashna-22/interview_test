            <br />
            <img src="images/diwalifamily.jpg" alt="Diwali" /><br />
            <p class="name">Being a grand festival, Diwali is celebrated over a period of 5 days, where each day is signified by certain rituals and traditions. The first day of Diwali, popularly known as Dhanteras, marks the beginning of Diwali.</p>
<br />
            <p class="name">On this day, people clean their houses as well as their workplace. Diyas are placed outside the house, doorways are decorated and beautiful rangolis are made. Since, it is considered to be an auspicious day, people also buy new items like clothes, jewellery and furniture. The second day of Diwali, also known as Choti Diwali, is Naraka Chaturdashi. The celebrations on this day indicate a sense of freedom from all kinds of suffering. A wide variety of sweets are prepared and distributed among relatives and friends.</p><br />
            <img src="images/celebration.jpg" alt="Diwali" /><br />
            <p class="name">The third day of the festival is known to be the main day of Diwali. Also known as Lakshmi Pujan, devotees welcome Goddess Lakshmi into their homes. They worship her and ask for her blessings. This is a day of celebration and joy as people burst crackers and meet up with their relatives and close friends. The fourth day of Diwali is the Govardhan Puja. It is a celebration of that time when Lord Krishna lifted the Govardhan Mountain on his little finger, to save the cowherd and all the farmers from dangerous floods.</p><br />
            <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="Jane Doe" /><br />
            <p class="name">The fifth and final day of Diwali, also known as Bhai Dooj, celebrates the beautiful bond shared by brothers and sisters. This is again a day of celebration and excitement, as brothers meet their sisters and offer them several gifts.</p>
